# GitHub Jira Tidy

This is a simple GitHub action to help close Jira issues associated to a GitHub issue based on a custom field. This is based on the contents of a release with an equivalently named milestone. When matched, the action will transition the issue to a specified status with a resolution of 'Done' and comment as to which release the issue was closed in.
